# PixelCapes
DON'T use this Code! You will Dos Github<br>
Yeah just some Cosmetics for me and friends

## How to use
Just download the mod. Minecraft Version 1.21, Fabric Version 1.60.0
It needs the Fabric API Version 0.102.0+1.21

Then just join a Server and you should have a Cape

## What if you don't have a cape?
Maybe i didn't give you one. Just message me on Discord(Xandarian) and ask for a cape!

### What is planned?
A reload command / general Cape reloading<br>
At this point, capes only reload on game restart
